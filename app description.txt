Expense tracker app

This is a basic expense tracker app. That will get more complex as we go


Its main features in release 1.0 include:

- Add new entries in both income and expenses
- Visualize the income and expense logs
- A database including category, description, date and amount
- A quick summary per month, nothing fancy
- Serving static files
- Filter buttons
- Debts, bills and push notifications
- Asset  and investments values
- A quick balance sheet, as I said, nothing fancy
- Simulators (i.e. debt repayment, compound interest, loan amortization)
